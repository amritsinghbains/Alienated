Alienated
=========
Here comes the first AUGMENTED REALITY GAME. This is a game which is played standing, and killing the aliens or spaceships that will be coming from outer space. Instead of moving our gun, etc(in 2D/3D games). Use phone as a gun and kill your enemy. 

Example:  

If an alien is coming from the backside of the user, the user would have to turn around physically and then point at the alien to kill it.

The cheapest form of motion sensing game now on Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8. Enjoy !
